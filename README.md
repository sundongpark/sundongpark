# Î∞ïÏÑ†Îèô (Sundong Park)
I am Sundong Park, an AI and software engineer specializing in computer vision and machine learning.
I received my M.S. in Software Convergence at Kyung Hee University in the [AIRLab (Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Lab)](http://airlab.khu.ac.kr).
I obtained my B.S. in [Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.khu.ac.kr) and [Software Convergence](http://swcon.khu.ac.kr) from [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr).
My research focused on Vision AI, including data-efficient learning, privacy-preserving AI, and real-time sensor processing for practical applications.
I am currently seeking opportunities to apply these experiences to smart manufacturing, robotics, and autonomous systems, where robustness and practical deployment are essential.
